# Elevation-Church-technical-project

Hello! This is my Elevation Church Technical Project. In this project, with the timeframe I had, I created a clone of the Elevation Church eGroups website using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project was as exciting as it was challenging, as both TypeScript and Tailwind CSS were brand new to me at the start. I look forward to completing this project in it's entirety after it is reviewed by the Elevation Digital team. Thank you!
